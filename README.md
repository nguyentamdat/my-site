This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

![Deploy Status](https://github.com/nguyentamdat/my-site/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)

This site is automatically built and deployed to **GitHub Pages** using the `pages.yml` workflow.

The project uses Next.js export mode to generate static files. Because the site
is served from `/my-site` on GitHub Pages, `next.config.ts` sets `basePath` and
`assetPrefix` to `/my-site`. Running `npm run build` outputs the site to the
`out` directory, which the workflow publishes automatically. Update these paths
if you deploy to a different location.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
